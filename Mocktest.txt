1.java is widely used object oriented programming language.it is used to devleop the web based based applications and mobile applications.
  it is invented by james gosling.

  javac is a tool that is used to compile the java program.

2.JDK:it is stands for java development kit.it is used to write and execute the java program.it contains tools and JRE.

  JRE: it is stands for java runtime environment.it is used to run and execute the java program.it contains libraries and JVM.

  JDK:it is stands for java virtual machine.it is used to execute the code.

3..java file:java file is saved file which is crated by the user.it will saved as a classname.java. it is used to represent the file of java program.
  .class file: it is one of the main file which generates source code into a bytr code.it will take the used written code and it will converted
   sorce code to byte code.

4.The java IDE's are:
  Notepad++.
  virtual studio code.
  Eclipse.
  Anaconda.
  Netbeans.

5.Variable is used to store the information.it is used to allocates the address of the memory location.
  types of variables are:
  *static level:
  *method level:

6.with the help of object we can create polymorphism,encapsulation,abstraction,inheritance and from the object oriented programming  we can create
  object 

7.public classXworkz
  {
  public static void main(String[] args){
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
  }
 }
 output:no statement return
 

8.data type is a different size or values stored in the variable is called data type.
  it has 2 types.
  *primitive datatype:primirive datatype is a predefined datatype.
   byte 8;
   char 's';
   int age=23;
   boolean true;
   float weight=23.5;
   long conatactNo=9876064563l;
   double distance=2.3;
   short pincode=577002;
   
  *non primitive datatype:it is a user defined datatype.
   Array;
   String name="anil";
   Any classes is non primitive data type.

9.dot operator are used to access the properties and methods of a class.
  Temple.name=name;

10.the java features are:
   exception handling.
   security.
   speed.
   automated garbage collection.
   multitasking.

11.Array is a collection of homogenous elements.array can be accessed by using index.
   if the array has been declared.it cannot be changed the size of an array.
   Example:int[] age={23,24,12,34,25};
           String[] name={"anil","madhu","kiarn","manthesh","hitesh"};
           float[] weight={61.3,68.9,76.3,54.6,62.5};

12.Class is a blueprint of creating a objects and it is uesd to create mathods and delaring datatype.
   class can also called as a non primitive datatype.data type or T
   Example:
          class Xworkz
          {
             }
    Object is instance of a class.it has two types
    *state(properties)
    *behavioyur(functionalities)
      Example:class Xworkz{
             public static void main(String[] args){
             Laptop laptop=new Laptop;
             }
            }

13.Keywords are reserved keywords.
   it can not be used as a variable or method name.
   it cannot be changed it is a predefined keywords.
   Ex:if,const*,public,private,for,class,return.

14.Constructor is a special method.
   it as a same name as a class name.
   it is used to initialize the instance variable.
   it has no return type.
   constructor will be default or parametarized.
   
15.it is amain method.jvm will starts the execution form main method.
   whenever we runs the program jvm will first execute the main method.

16.class Array
   {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    int[] array=[12,3,2,45,6,7,6];
    for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++){
       Sytem.out.println(array[i]);
       }
    }

17.method is a block of code.it will executes when it has been called.
   Example:
    class Name{
         void showName(){
             System.out.println();
              }
        }
  
   method overloading is a method having same name but having diferent parameters is method overloading.
   Example: 
           void displayAge(int age,String name)
               {
                 System.ot.println("age and name of the person"+age","+name);
               }
           void displayAge(String address,double weight)
               {
                 
                 System.ot.println("age and name of the person"+address","+weight);
               }
